                 Handicapped based on your league USGA nine hole handicap, which will be calculated using USGA nine hole handicap index calculations. Players playing for the first time in the league will establish their handicap on the first night of the league.
               </p>
               <p>Shotgun start will be at 5:00PM. Early and late in the season, the start time may move to 4:30PM.</p>
               <p>Each foursome will be assigned their starting hole prior to each league night. You may end up starting on the same hole multiple times in a row, but this would be by chance.</p>

               <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
               <p>Players will earn one point for every hole, where their net score is lower than their opponents net score</p>
               <p>Players will earn half a point for every hole, where their net score is the same as their opponents net score</p>
               <p>Example Night: Player A is a 9 handicap and is playing against Player B, who is a 10 handicap. Player A is giving Player B one stroke, which is given on the hardest hole out of the 9 holes played that night. All other holes are played straight up. If Player B and Player A both score a 5 on the hardest hole then Player B gets the point because he gets a stroke from Player A</p>

                 All putts within the "leather" of a standard sized putter are automatically good. This refers to the distance from the bottom of the grip down to the club head of the putter. To measure:
                 <ul>
                   <li>Place the putter head carefully inside the cup</li>
                   <li>Lay the putter flat on the putting surface</li>
                 </ul>
                 If any part of the ball is between the cup and the bottom of the grip, the putt is good.
                 <p>
                   <img src="assets/images/putter.png"></img>
                 </p>
               </p>
               <p>Any putts outside the leather (the bottom of the putter grip) of standard sized putters must be putted unless your opponent tells you that your putt is good. Your opponent can give you any putt from any distance. If your opponent gives you a putt and you decide to putt anyway, the putt is still good regardless of whether you make the putt or not.</p>
               <p>If your opponent has clearly won the hole, you can cooncede the hole and pick your ball up anywhere on the course. Just mark an "X" on your scorecard when you pick your ball up and concede the hole.</p>
               <p>
                 If a player hits a ball out of bounds, the player must drop/place their ball within two club lengths of where the ball crossed the OB line. The ball must NOT be dropped by where the ball came to rest. The ball must be dropped where it crossed the OB line. If in doubt, confer with your opponent on where the ball crossed the OB line.
                 <ul>
                   <li>The player can always re-tee or re-hit from the same spot after hitting the ball OB.</li>
                   <li>There is a one stroke penalty if a player hits the ball OB</li>
                 </ul>
                 Example: Player A hits their tee shot OB (Stroke #1), Player A drops by the OB line (Stroke #2), Player A is hitting their 3rd shot.
               </p>
               <p>If a player loses a ball during their match they must drop/place their ball within one club length of where they think the ball is. There is a one stroke penalty if a player has to drop as a result of a lost ball.</p>
               <p>If you are late to your match then mark an "X" on the holes that you miss</p>
               <p>If we get rained out and the course gives us rain checks then we will re-play the entire match</p>
               <p>If we get rained out and the course does not give us rain checks then we will try to finish the round before our next match. Generally, courses will give you a rain check if you play less than 5 holes when playing a 9 hole match</p>
               <p>You may roll the ball in the fairway, up to the length of one club head (approximately 6 inches)</p>
               <p>You may NOT roll the ball in the rough unless there is risk of hurting yourself or your club, such as a visible root or rock. You may NOT roll the ball in the rough to avoid an obstacle, give yourself room for a full swing, relief from hardpan or to give yourself a better shot to your target. If you have any doubt whether you can roll your ball in the rough then you probably should not roll the ball.</p>
               <p>All other rules of golf apply to our league</p>
               <p>You may not get relief from hardpan</p>

               <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
               <p>If a player is having a really bad hole and they are obviosly losing the hole then please pick up and record and "X" as your score. We will figure out the score to use for you on that hole. Basically, in order to figure out your score you cannot win the hole for match play and you cannot earn points in the stableford game. So, the best score you can get is a net double bogey, but it may be higher if your opponent has a high score</p>
               <p>
                 Other ways to speed up play
                 <ul>
                   <li>Play ready golf. If you are ready to hit and no one in your group is in your way nor are they about to hit their shot then hit your shot</li>
                   <li>Giving putts when your opponent has obviously lost the hole</li>

               <p>There is an 18.2 maximum 9 hole handicap allowed, per USGA rules</p>
               <p>
                 The score differentials are calculated as follows for a nine hole USGA handicap
                 <ul>
                   <li>(Score - (Course Rating/2)) * 113 / Slope Rating</li>

               </p>
               <p>The nine hole handicap is then calculated by taking an average of the lowest score differentials and multiplying that number by 96%</p>
               <p>Our league rounds our handicaps to the nearest whole number</p>
               <p>If we suspect sandbagging by anyone to drive their handicap up we will adjust their score accordingly, but we know that nobody in our league would cheat like this, so this will never become an issue</p>

               <h3><a id="skins"></a>Skins Game (optional)</h3>
               <p><a href="#top">Top</a></p>
               <p>You can play in the skins game even if nobody else in your foursome plays in it. The skins game is against everyone else who plays in it.</p>
               <p>Cost is $3 to participate each league night. You can pay for multiple weeks at a time and is actually preferred, so we don't have to collect money every night of the league. If you pay upfront then your money is used only when you play. If you do not play, your money is not entered into the skins game.</p>
               <p>
                 We will keep a skins bank for each player, which can be funded by your winnings or by cold hard cash
                 <ul>
                   <li>Every week that you play, $3 will be deducted from your skins bank</li>
                   <li>You have to have at least $3 in your skins bank to play in the skins game</li>
                   <li>We will not chase after anyone this year for skins money. If you want to play then fund your skins bank</li>
                   <li>If you forget to find us before the round, but still want to play then tell your opponents that you are playing in the skins game before you tee off and pay your $3 entry fee after the round</li>
                 </ul>
               </p>
               <p>Game is handicapped, so everyone has a fair chance of winning a skin</p>
               <p>
                 Game is a modified skins game. The modifications are
                 <ol>
                   <li>Maximum strokes allowed on Par 3s = 1 stroke, regardless of players handicap</li>
                   <li>Gross birdies win 1 share of the pot if there are no other birdies or eagles on the same hole</li>
                   <li>Gross eagles automatically win 2 shares of the pot and cancel out any gross birdies on the same hole, but do not cancel out other gross eagles on the same hole</li>
                   <li>Hole in one wins the entire pot and cancels out all other shares. In this case the player will undoubtedly be using the money to buy everyone else refreshments after the league</li>
                   <li>Lowest net score on each hole wins 1 share of the pot. Net score must be only one player with that score. If there are multiple low net scores on a hole then there is no ashare paid out for lowest net on that hole</li>
                   <li>Please putt out for all gross birdies and eagles. We are not making this an official rule because we are stating a gimmie is a gimmie regardless of your score on the hole. Keep in mind you are possibly going to win money for your score, so for your pride alone, please prove to yourself that you actually scored a birdie or eagle</li>
                 </ol>
               </p>
               <p>Any money left over after dividing the pot size each week by the number of shares each week will be put into a Mr. Skins pot. This pot will continue to grow throughout the session. At the end of the session whoever is the money leader and whoever has won the most shares in the skins game will split the Mr. Skins pot. For example, if one week there is $50 in the skins game & there are 6 winners then each winner will get $8. The $2 left over goes into the Mr. Skins pot. The Mr. Skins pot is only eligible for league members, but subs can play in the skins game each night.</p>
